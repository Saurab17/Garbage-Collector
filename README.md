# Garbage-Collector
`Garbage-Collector` is developed as part of the Memory Management Course of the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213).

# Building
To build this project, you will need a C++ compiler. The `make` script provided
assumes the GCC compiler, however you may substitute an equivalent C++ compiler
by adjusting the `make` script as needed. Execute the make script, then run the
compiled executable.

If the code fails to compile, the execute won't be created or will remain the
last-compiled version. Adjust your code to resolve compiler errors and try again.

``` shell
$ ./make
$ ./compiled
```
